# Query Processing & Optimization

## What have we covered in the last two lectures? 📚
- Disk and file organization
- Indices
  - B-trees
  - Hash

## Quiz Question 1: Index Types 🧩

**Question:** The hash index that maintains a $2^i$ directory, where $i$ denotes the number of bits in the hash function, is called:

- A. Static
- B. Dynamic
- C. Extensible
- D. Linear

**Answer:** C. Extensible

## What are the intended learning outcomes for this lecture? 🎯
- Be able to apply query processing strategies for selection and join
- Be capable of doing heuristic or cost-based query optimization

## What are the stages of query processing? 🚀
1. Query in high-level language
2. Scanning, Parsing, and Semantic Analysis => Intermediate form of query
3. Query Optimization => Execution Plan
4. Query Code Generator => Code to execute the query
5. Runtime Database Processor => Result of query

## What are the key operators used in query processing? 🛠️
- Selection ($\sigma$)
- Join ($\bowtie$)
- Projection ($\pi$)
- Set operations:
    - Cartesian Product (x)
    - Union (U)
    - Intersection ($\cap$)
    - Difference (-)
- Other operators:
    - Duplicate elimination
    - Sorting

## How does Selection work? (1/3) 👀
Selection can be applied in the following ways:
- Unique column, point: $\sigma_{filmID = 2}$ (Film)
- Point: $\sigma_{title = 'Terminator'}$ (Film)
- Range: $\sigma_{1 < rentalPrice < 4}$ (Film)
- Conjunction: $\sigma_{type = 'M' \land distributor = 'MGM'}$ (Film)
- Disjunction: $\sigma_{pubDate < 1990 \lor distributor = 'MGM'}$ (Film)

## How does Selection work? (2/3) 👀
Selection methods include:
- Linear search: Expensive, but always applicable
- Binary search: Applicable only when the file is appropriately ordered
- Primary hash table search: Single record retrieval; does not work for range queries; Retrieval of multiple records
- Clustering index search: Multiple records for each index item; Implemented with single pointer to block with first associated record
- Secondary index search: Implemented with multiple pointers, each to a single record

## How does Selection work? (3/3) 👀
- Conjunctive queries: Ideally, a composite index is applicable. Use the most selective index first. Intersect record pointers to perform conjunction.
- Disjunctive queries: Suggestion to use least selective index (condition) first. Little opportunity for improving performance.

## How does Join operation work? 🔗
- Sample: Customer ⋈ CheckedOut
- Strategies:
    - Nested-loops join
    - Index-based join
    - Sort-merge join
    - Hash join
- Strategies work on a per block (not per record) basis.
- Relation sizes and join selectivity impact join cost.

## What is a Nested-Loops Join? 🔄
- For each block of the outer table, scan the entire inner table
- Requires quadratic time, $O(n^2)$

## Quiz Question 2: Nested-Loops Join 🧩

**Question:** What is true for nested-loops join?

- A. Inner relation should be the largest
- B. Outer relation should be the largest
- C. Relations size doesn’t matter
- D. Total size matters only, when main memory is limited
- E. I don't know

**Answer:** B. Outer relation should be the largest

## What about other types of join strategies? 🔗
- Index-based Join: Requires at least one index on a join attribute
- Sort-Merge Join: Sort each relation using multiway merge-sort then perform merge-join
- Hash Join: Hash each relation on the join attributes. Each bucket must be small enough to fit in memory. Join corresponding buckets from each relation.

## How do other operators work? 🔗
- Projection: Example - $\pi$Name(Customer). Can be handled by sort and scan or by hashing into buckets.
- Cartesian product: Inherently expensive
- Union, intersection, and difference: Sort and scan or hash into buckets, check each bucket

## How does query optimization work? 🚀
- Transform the query into a faster, equivalent query
- Two approaches are used:
    - Heuristic (logical) optimization: Uses query tree (relational algebra) optimization
    - Cost-based (physical) optimization

## How does query tree optimization work? 🌳
Consider the example query:

```SQL
SELECT name
FROM Customer CU, CheckedOut R, Film F
WHERE title = ’Terminator’ AND F.filmID = R.filmID AND
CU.customerID = R.customerID AND CU.street = ’Elm’
```
The query is 'parsed' to create a query tree.

## Quiz Time! Spot the Errors 🧩

**Given Query:**

```SQL
SELECT Name
FROM Customer CU, CheckedOut R, Film F
WHERE title = 'Terminator' AND F.filmID = R.filmID AND
CU.customerID = R.customerID AND CU.street = 'Elm'
```

**Question:** How many errors do you see in the query?

- A. 1
- B. 2
- C. 3
- D. 4

**Answer:** B. 2

## What is Heuristic Query Optimization? 🚀
- Initial query tree is generated from the SQL statement.
- Query tree is transformed to create a more efficient version.
- Series of tree modifications are performed.
- Each modification aims to reduce the execution time.
- A single query tree is produced at the end.

## How Do We Apply Selections Early in Query Optimization? 🕰️
- `F.filmID = R.filmID` and `CU.customerID = R.customerID` are moved higher up in the tree.
- `title = 'Terminator'` is applied on Film and `street = 'Elm'` is applied on Customer.

## Why Should We Apply Restrictive Selections Earlier? ⏳
- The more restrictive a selection, the more records it eliminates, thus it's more beneficial to apply it earlier.
- For instance, `CU.customerID = R.customerID` and `F.filmID = R.filmID` are moved up in the tree.
- `street = 'Elm'` is applied on Customer and `title = 'Terminator'` on Film.

## How Do We Form Joins in Query Optimization? 🔗
- Joins are formulated on `CU.customerID = R.customerID` and `F.filmID = R.filmID`.
- `title = 'Terminator'` is still applied on Film and `street = 'Elm'` on Customer.

## Why Should We Apply Projections Early? 🎥
- Applying projections early can reduce the amount of data being processed.
- For instance, the customerID and filmID are projected before performing join operations.

## What is Cost-based Optimization? 💰
- Transforms to generate multiple candidate query trees from the canonical query tree.
- Requires statistics on the inputs to each operator.
- Cost formulas estimate cost of executing each operation in each candidate query tree.
- Cost can be CPU time, I/O time, communication time, main memory usage, or a combination.
- The query tree with the least total cost is executed at the end.

## Can You Give an Example of Cost-based Optimization? 💡
An example of cost-based optimization involves taking multiple steps to optimize a query, including using index selection, join operations, and main memory usage to minimize the total cost of executing a query.

## What is the Difference Between Heuristic and Cost-based Optimization? 🤔
- Heuristic Query Optimization: 
  - Produces a sequence of single query plans.
  - Each plan is presumed to be more efficient than the previous.
  - The search is linear.
- Cost-based Query Optimization:
  - Many query plans are generated.
  - The cost of each is estimated, with the most efficient one chosen.

Heuristic optimization is more efficient to generate, but may not yield the optimal query evaluation plan. Cost-based optimization relies on statistics gathered on the relations.

## Summary 📝
- You should now be able to apply query processing strategies for selection and join.
- You should also be able to do heuristic or cost-based query optimization.
