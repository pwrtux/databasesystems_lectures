- Compare and relate the concepts of bucket and block.
- Perform lookup, insert, and delete operations.
- Discuss the pros and cons of hash indices.

## What are Hash Tables and When are They Efficient?

Hash tables are efficient for equality search queries in one dimension (i.e., with a single search key). They use a bucket array containing $B$ linked lists. There is a hash function $h$ that takes a search key as an argument and computes an integer in the range $[0, B-1]$. If a record has a search key $K$, we store it by linking it to the list in bucket $h(K)$.

### Example
If we have a bucket array as below and a hash function $h$:

Bucket Array:
```
0: 0001
1: 1001, 1100
```
When we look up key $K=1001$, it will be stored in bucket $h(K)=1$.

## How do Secondary Storage Hash Tables Differ from Main-memory Hash Tables?

When main memory is not large enough, we use a similar principle on secondary storage. The bucket array consists of blocks. When a bucket block is full, we add a chain of overflow blocks. The primary difference is that blocks serve as the basic data containers instead of memory.

Performance is affected by overflow blocks, variations with a static and dynamic number of buckets, and the need to adapt the index to the amount of data to be indexed.

## How are Lookups Performed?

To perform a lookup, we apply the hash function to the search key. This gives us the bucket number where all records with this key are stored, if present.

## How are Insertions Performed?

To insert a record, we first perform a lookup to find the bucket for the search key of the record. The record is then stored in that bucket. If the bucket is full, we can increase the bucket size or add overflow blocks.

## How are Deletions Performed?

To delete a record, we first perform a lookup to find the bucket for the search key of the record. If the record is present, it is deleted. We can optimize deletions by moving records and removing empty blocks. The pros and cons of removing blocks need to be considered, especially if we perform a large number of insertions and deletions.

## Quiz Review

Question: How many buckets and how many blocks are represented in this picture?

```
0: 0001
1: 1001, 1100, 1010
```

Options:
A. 2 and 2
B. 2 and 3
C. 3 and 3
D. 3 and 2

Answer: A. 2 and 2

## How is Efficiency Achieved in Hash Tables?

If most of the buckets fit on one block, hash tables typically require:
- 1 I/O for lookups
- 2 I/Os for insertions and deletions

However, the efficiency varies depending on the size of the index (buckets and blocks) and data, and the distribution of the values of the search key relative to the hash function.

The solution to these potential issues is to avoid too many blocks per bucket and to vary the number of buckets depending on the data. This is achieved by extensible hashing (where $B$ doubles whenever considered too small) and linear hashing (where $B$ increases by one every time statistics on the index suggest so).

## What is an Extensible Hash Table and How Does it Work?

An extensible hash table uses an intermediate level for the buckets, consisting of an array of pointers to blocks. The array entries represent the buckets and a block may contain multiple buckets. Upon insert, if needed, the array grows by doubling its size. The number of buckets is a power of two and no overflow blocks are created. Not all bits are used to index the blocks, and each block contains a variable with the number of bits used to index it.

## How are Lookups Performed in Extensible Hash Tables?

To find a key, we use the hash function with the number of bits specified for indexing. For example, if we want to find 1100, and we have a directory as below:

```
i=1
0: 0001
1: 1001, 1100
```
We use hash function $h_1$ to get $h_1(1100)=1$ and find 1100 in bucket 1.

## How are Insertions Performed in Extensible Hash Tables?

Insertions in extensible hash tables involve a series of steps:

1. **Perform a Lookup:** Determine which bucket the record should be placed into based on its hash value. If the bucket is not full, the record is simply inserted into the bucket.

2. **Splitting Blocks:** If the bucket is full, then the number of bits used for the current block, $j$, is examined. If $j < i$, where $i$ is the index, the block is split into two. This is achieved by distributing the records using one more bit ($j + 1$ bits), incrementing $j$ to $j + 1$, and updating the directory with a pointer to the new block.

3. **Doubling Directory:** If $j = i$, $i$ is incremented to $i + 1$, and the directory is doubled so that each entry previously indexed by the sequence of bits $w$ produces two entries: $w0$ and $w1$. The process then proceeds as before, since now $j < i$.

### Example

Consider an existing extensible hash table with $i=1$, represented as below:

```
i=1
0: 0001
1: 1001, 1100
```

When we insert the key $K=1010$, the system first uses the hash function $h_1$ to find the bucket index $h_1(1010)=1$. Since the bucket is full, the system needs to split the bucket.

As $j=i=1$, the system increments $i$ to $i=2$ and doubles the directory. Now we have four buckets:

```
i=2
00: 
01: 
10: 
11: 
```

The keys are redistributed using $h_2$:

```
i=2
00: 0001
01: 
10: 1001, 1100
11: 
```

Now, the system can insert $K=1010$ to the 10th bucket:

```
i=2
00: 0001
01: 
10: 1001, 1100, 1010
11: 
```

## Quiz Review

Question: After inserting $K=1000$ into the extensible hash table below, how many buckets are represented?

```
i=3
000: 0001
001: 
010: 0100, 0101
011: 
100: 1001, 1000, 1010
101: 
110: 1100
111: 
```
Options:
A. 3
B. 4
C. 5
D. 8

Answer: C. 5 

The buckets represented are 000, 010, 100, 110, and 111. It's crucial to note that a bucket with no data is still considered a bucket.

## How do Insertions Work in Extensible Hashing?

In extensible hashing, the process of insertion follows these steps:

1. Perform a lookup for the correct bucket
2. If the bucket is not full, insert the record
3. Otherwise, let $j$ be the number of bits used for the current block

    - If $j < i$
        - Split the block into two
        - Distribute the records using one more bit, i.e., $j + 1$ bits
        - Set $j = j+1$
        - Update the directory with a pointer to the new block

    - If $j = i$
        - Set $i = i+1$
        - Double the directory, such that each entry previously indexed by the sequence of bits $w$ produces two entries: $w0$ and $w1$
        - Proceed as before, because now $j < i$

For example, consider the insertion of 1010. After multiple insertions and adjustments to the hash table, the insertion of 1010 leads to a split of the block as $j = i = 1$. The next insertion of 0100 does not lead to a split, but the subsequent insertion of 0101 does, as $j < i$.

### Quiz

Consider the insertion of 1000 into the existing hash table. According to the rules of extensible hashing, this leads to an increase in $i$ from 2 to 3, resulting in a split of the block and the insertion of 1000.

**Question:** How many buckets are represented in the hash table at the end of these insertions?

A. 3
B. 4
C. 5
D. 8

**Answer:** B. 4

## What is the Efficiency of Extensible Hashing?

Extensible hashing does not allow for overflow blocks. If the directory fits in main memory, it takes only one I/O operation per lookup. However, the directory may double multiple times if the search keys are not well-distributed. In such cases, the directory may no longer fit in memory or be temporarily inaccessible.

## How does Linear Hashing Work?

In linear hashing:

1. The number of buckets is set based on a fixed fill factor
2. The number of buckets increases by one, triggered by a condition indicating that the index is not large enough
3. Overflow blocks are allowed
4. No directories are used
5. The function $h_i(K)$ returns the $i$ bits to the right

For lookup in linear hashing, if $n$ is the number of buckets such that $2^{i-1} < n \leq 2^i$, and $h_i(K) = m$, then:

- If $m < n$, the looked up key is in bucket $m$
- If $m \geq n$, the looked up key is in bucket $m-2^{i-1}$

For insertions, when the ratio $r/n$ (where $r$ is the number of records and $n$ the number of buckets) becomes greater than a predefined threshold (e.g., 1.7), a bucket is split and a new bucket $n+1$ is added.

While $h_i$ is in use, the buckets from the first to number $2^{i-1}$ are split, independently of the bucket which caused the splitting. When $n$ becomes $2^i$, the function $h_{i+1}$ is started to use and the buckets are split from the first again.

### Quiz

After multiple insertions in the linear hash table, 

**Question:** How

 many blocks and buckets are represented?

A. 3 and 3
B. 3 and 4
C. 4 and 3
D. 4 and 4

**Answer:** D. 4 and 4

There are four blocks with records and four buckets in the hash table.

## Summary

These slides covered the operations of insertion and lookup in both extensible and linear hash tables, as well as the efficiency considerations of both methods. Linear hash tables allow for overflow blocks and increase the number of buckets based on a fixed fill factor, whereas extensible hash tables do not allow for overflow blocks and may double the directory multiple times based on the distribution of search keys.

## Self-Review

Hash tables are used for efficient data retrieval. In static hashing, the hash function is constant and does not change. Overflow buckets are used when the hash function results in more items for a hash value than can be stored in the available storage buckets. Dynamic hashing (like extensible and linear hashing) allows for the hash function to evolve as more elements are added to the database. 

In extensible hash tables, a directory is used to point to buckets. Upon insertion, the number of buckets is increased if necessary. Lookups and modifications cost typically one I/O if the directory is in memory. 

In linear hash tables, upon insertion, the number of buckets is increased if the load factor exceeds a threshold. For lookups, we need to compute the hash and possibly check an overflow bucket.
